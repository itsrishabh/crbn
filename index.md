### [Kotn](https://kotn.com/)
Basics, and now starting to get into home collections.

> At Kotn, we believe that traceability—the knowledge of where a product came from, who made it, how, and when—shouldn’t be a luxury, but a standard.

> That’s why we built Kotn from the ground up, working directly with every step of our supply chain, starting with the raw cotton. Think of it like farm-to-table, but for your clothes.

### [Nube](https://nubeusa.com/)

All of our goods are manufactured in the US from recycled materials using the best practices in sourcing and production with an aim on reducing waste and environmental impact.  But fighting climate change is no small task, so we had to ask some friends to help. We partner with artists and designers around the world to create prints motivated by the environmental crisis that inspire connection and action. We are proud to be woman-owned. We are proud to be US made. And we believe clothing can be a platform that sparks mindful consumption.
